Looking for a job is never easy, you have to put yourself out of your comfort zone, do things that you normaly don't do, find and discuss with many strangers and most of all be juged by them on specific exercices. It can be quite rude and take a lot of energy. But in coronavirus times, everything is harder. Less opportunities, harder contacts (only calls) and, above all, less enthousiasm.
But, even if news are pretty bad for the future, many compagnies still work well and recruit. And maybe the most robust ones.
All in all, I think recruiting is mostly a luck and timing challenge, and it could happen any time. 
Here are my ideas :
- contact companies you really like, for their product, their culture, their engineering reputation or even more basic reasons
- ask advices from people you respect (working with them, if they heard about some opportunities, make them aware of you and your situation, can be a long term investment)
- job boards: https://jobs.stationf.co
- you can use platforms such as talent.io
- reach at head hunters
