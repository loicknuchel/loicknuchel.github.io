Developers are often seen as basic code producer so organisations push them tasks to complete and put some tracking to see how they performs (estimations).

But developers are engineers, software engineers, even if they don't have the diploma. They are meant to solve problems rather than copy/pasting code from stack overflow.

Offer them global objectives and problem to solve. Mix them with other specialities such as UX, designers, marketers, support so they can have a better understanding and build more useful software.

Give them business value instead of asking them build cost: https://twitter.com/SoftLair/status/1245646875832635392
