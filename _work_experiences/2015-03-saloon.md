[Cookers](#cookers) was a great experience and I knew I will launch an other startup.
But I did not knew I will do it in a such short time frame.
In fact, it was a bit an irrational decision, I was discussing about recruitment and tech conferences with
[Hadil Filali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hadilfilali){:target="_blank"} when he was launching
[Sparkline](https://www.sparkline.fr){:target="_blank"}, a recruiting firm specialized in data jobs. From an idea to another
we came to the conclusion that meeting people in conferences is not as easy as we could think and it could be largely improved.
So we launched **SalooN**, an app to improve conference experience and optimize meetings.

We built the service and it was used at some conferences but we did not have a correct business model. Most (tech) conferences we know
do not have an extensive budget. So we went to tradeshows and had very nice meetings. We almost succeeded to win a tradeshow dedicated to tradeshow organizers ^^.

For that we had to fully switch our business model, from charging the tradeshow organizer for our service to charging tradeshow exhibitors
for additional opportunities and sharing revenue with the tradeshow organizer.

After 4 months and a lot of market discoveries, we had to rebuild everything with this new strategy.
At this time, [Sparkeline](https://www.sparkline.fr){:target="_blank"} took off and **Hadil** could not fully engage himself on the project so we decided to stop it.

After only 8 months it was a bit premature and I'm still convinced this is a good opportunity ;)

We open sourced all the code, not sure it has a lot of value but you can take a look if you are curious: [github.com/saloonapp](https://github.com/saloonapp){:target="_blank"}.
