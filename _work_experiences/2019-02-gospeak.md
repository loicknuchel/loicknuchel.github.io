Since my first experience I always had a strong connection with the public speaking and conference area.
With more than [40 talks](https://gospeak.io/speakers/loicknuchel){:target="_blank"} in various situations,
being an [HumanTalks Paris](https://gospeak.io/groups/humantalks-paris){:target="_blank"} organize since many years,
having launched [SalooN](#saloon) once and often pushing developers to experiment talks; it was quite obvious I had to build something like **Gospeak**.

**Gospeak** is a platform which provide tools for meetup organizers in order to streamline their tasks.
But it's also a platform for speakers to find speaking opportunities and get some help in the process.

I believe that public speaking can have a huge impact of developer success, as individuals but also community.

I want this project to be a community project, so the code is [open source](https://github.com/gospeak-io){:target="_blank"}
and I organized [mob programming sessions](https://gospeak.io/groups/gospeak){:target="_blank"} to get feedback and attract contributors.
