I left [TRF Retail](#trfretail) for a special year at [ENSIMAG](#ensimag) to learn programming basics which promised to be very intensive.
After that, I wanted a well established company for my final internship to learn from others in a professional environment.

**SFEIR** was a good choice for that. I was very lucky to have [Didier Girard](https://linkedin.com/in/didiergirard){:target="_blank"} as mentor and a nice team of interns.
We worked on many projects, discovering **GWT** and **Android** development together. But most importantly, I discovered Java meetups
([Paris JUG](https://www.parisjug.org){:target="_blank"} and [Ch'ti JUG](https://chtijug.org){:target="_blank"}) as well as internal tech talks every week.

I discovered many things, but the most important one was obviously the **tech community**.
I think my connection with the community comes from here and I owns to this experience to
organize [HumanTalks Paris](https://gospeak.io/groups/humantalks-paris){:target="_blank"} and
give [many talks](https://gospeak.io/speakers/loicknuchel#speaking-history){:target="_blank"} since then.
