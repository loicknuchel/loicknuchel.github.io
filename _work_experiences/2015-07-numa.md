While launching [SalooN](#saloon) I received the proposition from **Numa** to be a Freelance in residence.
The deal is really simple: I have a free co-working place in exchange to help incubated startups on the tech side.
For example helping for recruitment, giving some directions choosing a tech language or framework or debugging some code.

This was really interesting to see many startups, their challanges and to help them.
