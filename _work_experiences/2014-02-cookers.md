During my 6 month personal training on **Scala**, **Play framework**, **machine learning** and **recommender systems**
I discovered **TheFamily** and their [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Startupfood){:target="_blank"}.
When they launched [Koudetat](#koudetat) I could not resist, I had to take this opportunity and launch my own startup.
After a few classes I settle down for **Cookers**, an app to enhance customer experience in retail.
I already knew the area a bit, had a few connections thanks to [TRF Retail](#trf-retail) and food shopping was a daily struggle for me as it can be for many others.<br>
The idea was to build a nice self-scan experience using consumer smartphone. So he could build his shopping list at home based on basic recipes suggestions,
make his shopping using the app as an assistant (lists, nutrition, recipe suggestions, promos...) and skip checkout lines to go out.

Existing self-scan app were made by hardware industrial, with an horrible UI, UX and even blocking bugs.
They were focused on the scan action for a single store and filled with shop ads.
Our goal was to make a global experience, from ideas, to store and cooking with an awesome UX <i class="fas fa-magic"></i>

We launched a recipe app with a shopping list and started negotiations with some retailers to work with them (Intermarch√©, Casino, Naturalia...) but we were not at the same pace (obviously!).
We stopped after one year of intense work and learnings. We earned no money but it was really worth the time invested to develop an understanding
of what is it to launch a business and have a much more open view than just the developer one.
Meeting a lot of various people (other entrepreneurs, retailer directors, competition...) was also a big win and it makes me realize that networking
is key but you need a good reason to do it seriously (startup or freelance is <i class="far fa-smile-wink"></i>).

All the code is open source, you can see it on [github.com/cookersapp](https://github.com/cookersapp){:target="_blank"}.
