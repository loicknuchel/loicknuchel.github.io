I choose [Phelma](#phelma) for nanotechnologies because I was amazed by some researches published in scientific reviews
but once I got there, fundamental physics was much more complex than I thought and not so fun. So I moved into micro-electronics which were more appealing.
But when I discovered programming, I was amazed by building awesome things at high speed (I did several programs such as micro-processor simulator or sudoku solver).

During my second year, I decided to move to a software engineer career but not before I had seen what micro-electronic engineer would look like.
This was the purpose of this internship.

It was quite interesting, I worked on a cutting edge technology to allow **FPGA** (a programmable electronic ship) to reconfigure itself during execution.
It could be a game changer to optimize for performance, energy efficiency or even fully change the ship behavior.
All this is done using **VHDL** language so it is quite similar to software, except you have to understand the electronic concepts you work with.

This was my first experience abroad (**Belfast**) and it was really great, I got a nice recommendation but software is more fun and more related to our daily life so I decided to continue into it.
