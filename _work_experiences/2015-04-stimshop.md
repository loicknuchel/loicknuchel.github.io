**Stimshop** is a company building a location system based on ultrasound. 
I met them as provider when working on [Cookers](#cookers) to track client position inside the store.
But this time, they needed my hybrid mobile experience to build a cordova plugin for their native sdk and a mobile app for a short event.
Again, hybrid development is amazing: two days to build the plugin (I'm not used to it ^^) and two days for the app. Packaged. **Done!**
