Same as [Kpler](#kpler), I have done this mission during the launch of [Cookers](#cookers).
But this time it was to do a favor to a friend.

I had to make a working prototype for an investor.
I worked with a designer and had to integrate his design and develop the frontend interactions and some backend features.
