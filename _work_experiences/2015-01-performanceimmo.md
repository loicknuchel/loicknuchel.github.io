With the end of [Cookers](#cookers), I returned to freelancing to earned some money.
I have met [Nicolas Marx](https://linkedin.com/in/nicolasmarx){:target="_blank"} a year before and had recommended
[Nicolas Martignole](https://linkedin.com/in/nmartignole){:target="_blank"} to work together but the project did not start back then.
Luckily for me, it started at the end of 2014 and I could on-board a few months later with [Ugo Bourdon](https://linkedin.com/in/ugo-bourdon-41587438){:target="_blank"}.

The product was a ticketing platform for joint property managers, starting from the beginning with a few clients.
A nice opportunity to re-start my freelance experiences from which I keep very good memories.
