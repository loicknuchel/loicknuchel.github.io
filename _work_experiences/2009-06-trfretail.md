After discovering **C** programming in my first year at engineering school and doing some **HTML**/**CSS**/**JS** to build a website for my BDE list (which lost <i class="far fa-sad-tear"></i>).
I decided to go ahead with programming and found this awesome opportunity for my first internship.

It was a very young startup in retail doing store optimizations based on assortment data (inventory, sells, position...). I wrote a **C** program to
compute product KPIs and generate recommendations as well as a **PHP**/**MySQL** website to expose them to clients and collect their feedback through an iterative workflow.

The internship was an amazing experience so I accepted to stay and work their in the same time of my second year at my engineering school.
I worked every evening and weekends and it was really pleasant as I could build a useful service out of my owns hands.
Pushing features everyday to answer client needs and fixing bugs in real time, everything in full remote ^^

Thinking about it again, it was probably my most agile experience, done without any formal knowledge about it...
