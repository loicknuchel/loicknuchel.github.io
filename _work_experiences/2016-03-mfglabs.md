For this mission, I was looking into a opportunity to work on a serious Scala company. **MFG Labs** had a strong reputation about it and was ideal for me.
This is the reason I didn't canceled it to extend my [Sidexa](#sidexa) experience ^^

I worked on the biggest project of the company, a multi publishing platform for publicity campaigns.

Sadly, code quality were pretty low and I didn't succeed to make a point about it, so it decided to move on to a new high level Scala opportunity.
