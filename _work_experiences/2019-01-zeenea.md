Having built an internal data catalog at **Criteo**, I truly believe it's a key component of understanding and productivity for people working with data.
This is why I decided to join **Zeenea**, a young startup building a data catalog and advocating for a bottom-up strategy.

I signed as a Scala developer but participated in many aspects. From recruitment process and interviews, to product strategy and features, passing by the marketing,
communication and even culture. I used all my knowledge (from [Koudetat](#koudetat), [Cookers](#cookers), [SalooN](#saloon)...) and energy to push it forward.

On the tech side, I proposed to write and follow some Scala best practices and suggested many initiative to keep the team focused,
such as mob programming sessions, watching tech and startup videos at lunch or keeping a 20% load for technical improvements (which lead to great wins!).
After a few months I took the scrum master role and just after the team lead responsability.

**Zeenea** was a very interesting and intense experience where I learned a lot on mentoring a team and managing goals.
