My first freelance mission! <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i> <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i> <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>

It was a short mission done in the same time as [Cookers](#cookers) to earn some money.

**Kpler** is a small startup (3 people at that time) which track gaz boats around the globe for traders.

I helped them to migrate their app from server side rendering using **Twirl** to an **AngularJS** SPA.
