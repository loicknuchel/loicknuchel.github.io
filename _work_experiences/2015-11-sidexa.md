The two previous experiences were quick and done in the same time than [SalooN](#saloon). But this one is a bit special to me...

They called me the day just after we decided to kill [SalooN](#saloon), perfect timing to get some fresh cash!
The job did not make me dream: they do software for auto repairer and wanted to launch a mobile app to help diagnostics.
They hired a web agency but after 6 months of work (including 3 late), they decided to stop the contract and
call some freelances to finish the job (mostly debugging). We had 3 months to put the app on the market.
In any other situation I would have said no but they paid well, this is just a few months and they came at the perfect time.
